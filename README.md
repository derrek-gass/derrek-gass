### Full-Stack Engineer ###

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a VST plugin for exploring vector modulated distortion similar to Minimal Audio's Rift or Output's Thermal.
- 💻 Fluent in Java, sharp with TypeScript, capable but not yet dangerous with SQL, and spent plenty of time in React to both love and hate it.
- 🌱 Other skills I'm growing: C++, bash (simple but powerful), Python (I dont love it, but I need it), Cloud/DevOps stuff (K8s, Docker, AWS, etc.)
- 😴 Programming languages I've used but that bore me: PHP, Perl, Ruby, ASM, Scheme, VisualBasic... Everyone should make pong with their buddy at 16... that was a mood!
- ⏳ Languages that seem cool but I have no time to get good with: Clojure, Rust
- 🎸 I’m looking to collaborate on music projects. Let's jam and show off our processing chains and talk about the future of music. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can type 57 words per minute. 😄 Just kidding... I can spin fire though, was a mathlete, and wrestler.
