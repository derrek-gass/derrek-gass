### Full-Stack Engineer
https://derrekgass-cv.herokuapp.com/

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects with React with the TypeScript superset, and Java w/ Spring.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more React, TypeScript, higher level software achitecture, IaaS principles, how to make an organization function better... how to increase my velocity and enhance workflows for myself and those around me, how to facilitate better meetings with stakeholders, how to produce higher quality software, and overall how to be a better human.

- âš¡ In my free time, I like to hike, backpack, ski, garden, solve puzzles, build computers, fix electronics, install linux where it doesn't belong, upcycle everything, learn finance, finess networks, secure IoT for fun smart-home projects, write creative software (audio/visual), produce music, and stay fit as best as possible.
